        <h1>Matching Algorithms -  The Perfect Job, The Perfect Partner</h1>

        <p>Anyone who has ever dated or looked for a job is familiar with the matchmaking process.  It&rsquo;s often
        a costly, and time-consuming process to find the right &lsquo;one.&rsquo;  Various platforms attempt to match users
        with one another. As the number of users on these platforms increases, there is endless opportunity for
        complexity.</p>

        <p>Algorithmic Matching uses data from your users, such as their preferences, and usage habits to recommend
        the perfect set of matches. It&rsquo;s a challenging problem, that resembles a &ldquo;bi-directional&rdquo; recommendation:
        you might like someone, but they also have to like you back for there to be a match.</p>

        <p>With the Orion Matching API, finding the perfect match, has never been easier. In four simple steps, you
        can easily have a matching system in place to optimally pair users.</p>

            <h1>HOW TO WORK WITH SERIAL METRICS</h1>

            <h2>Integrating Orion</h2>
            <p class="description">Integration requires loading our Java SDK, which scans your databases for relevant, and predicatively valuable features.</p>

            <h2>Learning About Users</h2>
            <p class="description">Our system will then develop an initial model from the column variables automatically mined from your database.</p>

            <h2>Fine-tuning Predictions</h2>
            <p class="description">To test the efficacy of the predictive models, Serial Metrics fine tunes model parameters to reduce type-1 and type-2 statistical errors.</p>

            <h2>Deploying Results</h2>
            <p class="description">The final model deploys as an API which monitors your database for new users, or changes to current user&rsquo;s tastes/behavior, and writes scores to a designated &lsquo;propensity&rsquo; table.</p>

            <p>All you need to do is query the propensity table for matches.</p>
