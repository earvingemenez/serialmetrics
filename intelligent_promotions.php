        <h1>Intelligent Promotions -  The Right Deal at the Right Time</h1>

        <p>Engages users that are less likely to purchase from your site with deals, coupons, discounts, or other
        offers before they leave your site without making a purchase.  Instantly identify the users that will
        buy from your store, know when they will buy,  and even know the exact purchase amount.  Indiscriminately
        offering deals to site visitors - in the form of discounts or coupons - is very often revenue sub-optimal.
        If we can simply identify users that are least likely to purchase, but most likely to respond to a promotion,
        and target them exclusively, and instantly upon their visiting your site, then we can maximize returns on
        promotional campaigns.</p>

            <h1>HOW TO WORK WITH SERIAL METRICS</h1>

            <h2>Integrating Orion</h2>
            <p class="description">Integration requires loading our Java SDK, which scans your databases for relevant, and predicatively valuable features.</p>

            <h2>Learning About Users</h2>
            <p class="description">Our system will then develop an initial model from the column variables automatically mined from your database.</p>

            <h2>Fine-tuning Predictions</h2>
            <p class="description">To test the efficacy of the predictive models, Serial Metrics fine tunes model parameters to reduce type-1 and type-2 statistical errors.</p>

            <h2>Deploying Results</h2>
            <p class="description">The final model deploys as an API which monitors your database for new users, or changes to current user&rsquo;s tastes/behavior, and writes scores to a designated &lsquo;propensity&rsquo; table.</p>

            <p>All you need to do is query the propensity table for matches.</p>
