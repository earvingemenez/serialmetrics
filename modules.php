									<h1>Dynamic Pricing - Extract Value on Demand</h1>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-12 content">
								<p>Assigns the optimal price to goods such that each unit of inventory is sold to achieve revenue-optimality.
								Should you raise prices, or lower them?  Should you give a discount just this once, or just to a certain
								set of users.  When should you increase prices? Will the users return to your site if your prices are too high?
								These are all common questions that online retailers ask. What if, though, you could set prices dynamically
								to extract as much value as possible from each user?  Or, what if you could estimate the one, best, price
								that the majority of your customers can pay so you can maximize your revenues.  Our dynamic pricing module
								does just this, and more, including real-time demand fluctuations (changes in demand, or price elasticity
								of demand), and can make corrective action! Imagine a control system for regulating prices.</p>

								that you wanted, before you even thought of it.  Amazing, right?  Amazing, but completely possible.</p>

									<h1>Text Classification - Find Meaning, not Keywords</h1>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-12 content">
								<p>Structures free-form text into sets of topic categories.  Imagine needing to organize volumes of text into
								ordered categories. This can be quite the manual process! One way to do this is reading each document,
								searching for keywords, then organizing the texts into categories based on keywords that arise. But, is this
								the best way? Our text classification module extracts themes from documents based on term frequencies.
								Forget keywords.  If you can assign topics to documents dynamically, then you don&rsquo;t need to have a list of
								categories a priori.  What&rsquo;s more, if two topics are too closely, cognitively, related, we can identify
								those topics, and coalesce them into broader categories,  accordingly.</p>

								<p>Engages users that are less likely to purchase from your site with deals, coupons, discounts, or other
								offers before they leave your site without making a purchase.  Instantly identify the users that will
								buy from your store, know when they will buy,  and even know the exact purchase amount.  Indiscriminately
								offering deals to site visitors - in the form of discounts or coupons - is very often revenue sub-optimal.
								If we can simply identify users that are least likely to purchase, but most likely to respond to a promotion,
								and target them exclusively, and instantly upon their visiting your site, then we can maximize returns on
								promotional campaigns.</p>

								estimated event likelihood, given a set of facts (or features). You can score anything from nutritional
								quality to lead quality.</p>
