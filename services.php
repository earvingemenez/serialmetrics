		<h1>Services</h1>
		<p>Our Experts work with you to ensure that you efficiently solve your 
		Machine Learning challenges.  Our consulting services cover three basic areas:</p>

		<h2>Custom Machine Learning</h2>

		<h3>Remote Model</h3> 
		<p>Your company provides us data, we build solutions - 
		offsite (include the methodology section on the current site)</p>

		<h3>Onsite Model</h3>
		<p>We deploy staff, onsite, at your company to work with 
		your teams.  This model works quite well for companies that might need 
		'full-time', dedicated, data science resources, but don't want to take the hire staff in-house.</p>


		<h2>Module Implementation</h2>
		<p>Over the last five years we've built a suit of 
		machine learning applications.  We refer to these applications as "modules." 
		Often, Data Science solutions require thinking through some very challenging, 
		mathematically rigorous, modeling problems. Companies might spend months just 
		trying to model a seemingly unique business problem  - a processes that typically 
		requires hiring a team of engineers to mine data, formulate a hypothesis, code a 
		set of algorithms, and test for model accuracy.  Interestingly, rarely are these 
		business problems truly unique.  Instead, we find that different verticals try 
		solving the same problems day in day out.  For example gaming companies seem 
		particularly interested in solving problems relating to attrition, whereas 
		advertising companies seem perplexed by improving the conversion rates.</p>

		<p>The benefit of the modules is that they prevent companies from having to reinvent the wheel.  
		If a dynamic pricing algorithm exists, why not just use it? Similarly if the system exists that 
		can predict churn, why not just leverage it. There's really very little point to reinvent the algorithm.</p> 

		<p>The serial metrics modules eliminate the need to apply machine learning solutions 
		to solve problems that need machine learning solutions. These modules only require 
		you to plug in your data and will provide an answer. Super simple.</p>
